## 🔧 API Endpoints

### Main Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/` | GET | Web UI (index.html) |
| `/distribute` | POST | Calculate optimal distribution |
| `/custom-distribution` | POST | Test custom chip configuration |
| `/inventory` | GET | View current chip inventory |
| `/inventory` | PUT | Update chip inventory |
| `/health` | GET | Health check |
| `/docs` | GET | Interactive API documentation |
| `/api` | GET | API information |

### Example API Call

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/distribute" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "num_players": 6,
    "buy_ins": [100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100],
    "small_blind": 1,
    "big_blind": 2,
    "include_alternatives": true,
    "max_alternatives": 5
  }'
```

## 🎰 Algorithm Highlights

### Intelligent Multiplier Selection
- Finds chip value that makes mental math easy (0.01, 0.1, 1, etc.)
- Considers blind structure for optimal play
- Targets 100-200 big blind starting stacks

### Smart Distribution
- **Large chips**: 35-40% of stack value (max 8 chips)
- **Medium chips**: 25-30% of stack value (max 8-10 chips)
- **Small chips**: Capped at 20 chips (prevents impractical distributions)
- **Balanced approach**: Easy to distribute, practical to use

### Inventory Management
- Validates against available chips
- Reports exact shortages by denomination
- Suggests multiple alternative distributions
- Handles partial inventory gracefully

4. **Styling changes**: Edit `static/styles.css`
5. **Test locally** before deploying

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**UI not loading:**
- Check that `static/` directory exists
- Verify files are copied in Dockerfile
- Check browser console for errors

**API not responding:**
- Verify server is running on correct port
- Check health endpoint: `/health`
- Review server logs

**Deployment issues:**
- Check Dockerfile builds locally first
- Verify all required files are included
- Check platform logs (Railway, Render, etc.)

**Static files not found:**
- Ensure `static/` is copied in Dockerfile
- Verify FastAPI is mounting static files correctly
- Check file paths in HTML (use `/static/...`)

## 🎯 Deployment Recommendation

### For Your Use Case: **Railway**

**Why Railway is best for this project:**

1. **Docker Native**: Built for containerized apps like this
2. **Free Tier**: Perfect for personal/hobby use (500 hours/month)
3. **Automatic HTTPS**: No certificate management needed
4. **Simple Setup**: Deploy in 2 minutes with CLI or GitHub
5. **FastAPI Optimized**: Works perfectly with Python web apps
6. **Environment Variables**: Easy configuration management
7. **Logs & Monitoring**: Built-in observability
8. **Custom Domains**: Add your own domain easily
9. **Zero Config**: Just point to repo and it works
10. **Great for Scale**: Can upgrade as usage grows

**Vercel is NOT recommended** because:
- Optimized for serverless/Next.js, not traditional Python web apps
- Would require significant refactoring to serverless functions
- Not ideal for stateful applications or WebSocket support
- FastAPI works better on Railway/Render

**Alternative: Render** is also excellent if you prefer:
- Similar to Railway
- Good free tier with auto-sleep after inactivity
- Great for production apps
- Slightly different pricing model
