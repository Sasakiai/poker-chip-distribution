## üöÄ Quick Start

### Local Development

1. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   cd poker-chip-distribution
   python api.py
   ```

2. **Open your browser:**
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

### Docker

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000`

## üìñ Usage Guide

### Basic Calculation

1. **Enter number of players** (1-20)
2. **Set buy-in amount** (in PLN or your currency)
3. **Configure blind structure** (small blind and big blind)
4. **Click "Calculate Distribution"**

The UI will show:
- ‚úÖ Optimal chip distribution with multiplier
- üìä Chip counts per player in a clear table
- üí∞ Total chips needed from inventory
- üéØ Stack depths in big blinds
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Any inventory shortages

### Advanced Features

#### Variable Buy-ins

Enable **"Variable buy-ins per player"** to set different buy-in amounts for each player:

```
Player 1: 100 PLN
Player 2: 200 PLN
Player 3: 150 PLN
```

Perfect for:
- Players with different budgets
- Re-buys and add-ons
- Tournament structures

#### Force Multiplier

Use **Advanced Options ‚Üí Force Multiplier** to lock a specific chip value:

- `0.01` = 1 chip = 0.01 PLN (1 cent)
- `0.1` = 1 chip = 0.10 PLN (10 cents)
- `1` = 1 chip = 1 PLN

Useful when:
- You want consistency across multiple games
- You have a preferred chip value
- You're matching a specific tournament structure

#### Alternative Distributions

By default, the calculator shows up to 5 alternative distributions if the optimal one has chip shortages.

Each alternative shows:
- Different multiplier
- Different chip distribution
- Feasibility status
- Stack depth comparison

## üéØ Understanding Results

### Result Components

#### 1. Recommendation Banner

- **Yellow (‚ö†)**: Shortages detected, alternative suggested
- **Red (‚úó)**: No feasible solution with current inventory

#### 2. Configuration Info
- **Multiplier**: How much each chip is worth in real money
- **Chip Values**: Human-readable explanation (e.g., "1 chip = 0.01 PLN")
- **Stack Depth**: How many big blinds each player gets
- **Total Buy-in**: Combined buy-in from all players

#### 3. Chip Distribution Table
Shows exactly how many chips each player receives:
- Color-coded by denomination (white, red, green, blue, purple, gold)
- Easy to read and follow
- Ready for chip distribution at the table

#### 4. Total Chips Needed
Summary of chips required from your inventory:
- Visual chip indicators with colors

### Chip Colors

The UI uses standard casino colors:
- **White**: 1 chip
- **Red**: 5 chips
- **Green**: 25 chips
- **Blue**: 100 chips
- **Purple**: 500 chips
- **Gold**: 1000 chips

## üí° Tips & Best Practices

### For Home Games

1. **Start with the default inventory** (500 of each denomination)
2. **Use round numbers** for buy-ins (10, 20, 50, 100 PLN)
3. **Aim for 100-200 BB stack depths** for cash games
4. **Keep 20-50% extra chips** for re-buys

### For Tournaments

1. **Use force multiplier** for consistent chip values
2. **Plan for color-ups** at higher blind levels
3. **Higher stack depths** (200-300 BB) for deeper play
4. **Account for re-entries** in chip planning

### For Mixed Games

1. **Enable variable buy-ins** for different stakes
2. **Check alternatives** for flexibility
3. **Keep extra small denominations** for side pots
4. **Document your setup** for future reference

Edit `main.py`:

```python
